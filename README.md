# Deques and Randomized Queues

## Dequeue.

Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

Dequeue. A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

Corner cases.  Throw the specified exception for the following corner cases:

Throw an IllegalArgumentException if the client calls either addFirst() or addLast() with a null argument.
Throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls either removeFirst() or removeLast when the deque is empty.
Throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls the next() method in the iterator when there are no more items to return.
Throw an UnsupportedOperationException if the client calls the remove() method in the iterator.


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
